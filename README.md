## Background

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All needed to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

Create a table dynamically based upon a (StarterCode/static/js/data.js). 
Allow users to filter the table data for specific values, use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on web pages.

### Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Created a basic HTML web page use the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* Have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Dataset
